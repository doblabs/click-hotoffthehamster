# AFAIK Makefile uses double-colon (`recipe:: `) to chain recipes for the
# same targets, but overriding recipes is discouraged (by the community,
# by 2 scolding warning message, and because in practice I've seen it
# not work as expected), and there's no way for Makefile to test if a
# recipe is already defined before defining one. So we need to be
# explicit that we defined the 'develop' recipe.
